                <p>Hello, my name is Eric Ward and I want to tell you a few things about me. I was born
                    and raised in Delaware, and the youngest of 7 kids. While in 8th grade, I went on a
                    field trip to Russia for 10 days. That was in 1991. <br> <br> In high school I took 4
                    years of Spanish class and I also had friends
                    from diverse cultures and backgrounds. When I was 19, I was a missionary for my
                    church (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) in Paraguay where I spoke
                    Spanish and learned the Guarani language. <br> <br> A
                    few
                    years
                    later, in 2001, I married a beautiful and intelligent girl from Peru. We met in
                    Utah. We have 5 kids; 3 boys and 2 girls, and my family is the treasure in my life.
                    As a family, we love to travel. We have been to Peru a few times, Mexico a couple of
                    times, gone on two cruises, Disneyland, Dana Point (CA), Oregon, and Delaware.
                    <br> <br>
                    Most recently, we went to Portland, Oregon to visit my brother-in-law at
                    Christmastime.
                    One day we traveled to Seaside, OR and enjoyed the beach and got to eat some fish
                    and
                    chips.
